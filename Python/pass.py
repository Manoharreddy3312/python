# Part3:Pass statement

age=19
if age>=18:
    pass


#Q7:Detect vowels
# Write a python program that iterates through each character in a string. If the character is a vowel, do nothing(pas), If it is a consonent,print it.


# s=input('Enter a string:')
# for i in s:
#     if i in 'aeiouAEIOU':
#         pass
#     else:
#         print(i)
        
        
# Q8. Future condition
# Write a loop from 1 to 10. If the number is divisible by 4, just use pass (indicating that condition will be handled later). For all other numbers, print them.

# for i in range(1, 11):
#     if i % 4 == 0:
#         pass    
#     else:
#         print(i)




# Q9. Placeholder function
# Create a Python function named future_feature() that currently does nothing but will be developed later. Use the pass statement inside it.
# def future_feature():
#     pass
