#! OOPs: 
========
# (Object Oriened Programming structure)

# ! ==> it is an concept which is used to provide the structure to the program

# ! ADV & DIS-Adv

#! 1.structured code 
#! 2.code enhanceability
#! 3.code reusability
#! 4.connecting multiple members or properties
#! 5.provide security


#! 1. CLASS: 
==>BLUE PRINT OF AN OBJECT(structure OF THE Object)
==>WHICH WILL STORE THE FUNCTIONALITY OR PROPERTY OF AN OBJECT

CLASS CREATION:
syntax:

class Class_name:
properties/functionallity

EXAMPLE:

class Vehicle:
    vehicle_name = 'Ferroryy'
    vehicle_color = 'Black'

print(Vehicle.vehicle_color)
print(Vehicle.vehicle_name)

2.OBJECT : IT IS A REAL WORLD ENTITY OR AN INSTANCE OF A CLASS

# OBJECT CREATION:
obj_name = Class_name(args) ==>#args are optional



# !static method:

# it is an method which id independent of object and class members
# creation is done with the help of @staticmethod decorator
# if calling is done with the help of self it becomes object/instance
# static method
# if calling is done with thehelp of cls it becomes class
# static method

TYPES OF OOPS:
=============   

1.INHERITANCE:
=============
- IT IS AN PROCESS IN WHICH THE CHILD/SUB/DERIVE CLASS WILL ACQUIRE THE PROPERTY FROM PARENT/SUPER/BASE CLASS



                    CLASS-A ==> PARENT/SUPER/BASE CLASS
                      |
                      |
                    CLASS -B ==>CHILD/SUB/DERIVE


TYPES OF INHERITANCE:  5-types
=====================

1.SINGLE-LEVEL INHERITANCE
2.MULTI-LEVEL INHERITANCE
3.MULTIPLE INHERITANCE
4.HEIRARICAL INHERITANCE
5.HYBRID INHERITANCE


1.SINGLE-LEVEL INHERITANCE:
==========================
=> IT IS AN PROCESS IN WHICH THE CHILD/SUB/DERIVE CLASS WILL ACQUIRE THE PROPERTY FROM PARENT/SUPER/BASE CLASS 

syntax:
======
    class Parent:
        properties/functionality
    class Child(Parent):
        properties/functionality
        
                    CLASS-A ==> PARENT/SUPER/BASE CLASS
                      |
                      |
                    CLASS -B ==>CHILD/SUB/DERIVE CLASS

#============================================================================
# ! 3.Multiple inheritance:
# ========================
# this is a type of inheritance where multiple parent have single child


                 CLASS-A              CLASS-B
                        \             /
                         \           /
                          \         /  
                           \       /
                            CLASS-C


#============================================================================
#============================================================================

#! HIERARICHAl INHERITANCE:
# ========================

#  it is an concept where parent and multiple child are present


                    class - A
                       |
      --------------------------------------------
      class-B      class-c     class-D      class-E


      syntax:
      =======

  class A: 
    properties

  class B(A): 
    properties

  class C(A): 
    properties

  class D(A): 
    properties

  class E(A): 
    properties
#============================================================================

# ! HYBRID INHERITANCE:
=======================

# IT IS AN COMBINATION OF MORE THAN TWO TYPE OF INHERITANCE

                            CLASS-A      
    ---------------------------------------------------------                   
    CLASS-B                                               CLASS-C
  -----------                                            ---------------
  CLASS-D                                              CLASS-F    CLASS-G
    |
  CLASS-E                                             


syntax:
========

class A:
  properties
class B(A):
  properties
class C(A):
  properties
class D(B):
  properties
class E(D):
  properties
class F(C):
  properties
class G(C):
  properties
